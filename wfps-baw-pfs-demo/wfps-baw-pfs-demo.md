# Videos for WfPS BAW PFS demo

In part 1 with two different browsers the use of the applications is presented.

On BAW we use /ProcessPortal, on WfPS we use /Workplace.

It is shown how the PFS and its mechanisms allow you to work and share tasks and processes operating on different runtimes and from different portals.

The /ProcessPortal alone offers a complete view of the tasks and processes of all federated runtimes.

The WfPS runtime /Workplace portal does not offer federated access capabilities and allows the user to interact only with applications deployed in WfPS.
